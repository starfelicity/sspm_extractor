## SSPM Extractor
This script can extract cover images, audio files, metadata and notes from .sspm (v2) files and directories containing .sspm (v2) files, which are commonly associated with the rhythm game Rhythia.

The note data output is compatible (at the time of writing) with the current version of Sound Space Quantum Editor.


### Usage:
- **Step 1**: Install the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option in the installer if you are on Windows!
- **Step 2**: Either clone this repository or download `sspm_extractor.py` directly as a single file
- **Step 3**: Open your command line (Windows) or terminal (Linux, MacOS) and run the file using `python sspm_extractor [path to the .sspm file or directory you want to extract]`
